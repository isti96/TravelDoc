# TravelDoc

Hello!

This project is about a mini-api where you can search about what document you need if you want to travel somewhere.
It does not have real information about documents.

After you selected from where you want to travel to and selected your age, you hit the GO button and it shows you whether you need a visa or a passport to entry in the specific country.
To build the api I used Express.js and Mongoose to communicate with the MongoDB database
To make the api get requests for the list of countries and the result from the MongoDB database , as a query, I used the Express.js framework for Node.js and the Mongoose library, which allows to communicate with the database easily.
