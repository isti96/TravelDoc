# TravelDoc

Hello!

The idea of this project would be to help you finding the required documents when traveling. Currently the app works with mock data and that's why the outputs are not so accurate. 

You just have to select your destination, the country you want to travel from and your age. After filling all required fields, hit the GO button and it will show you whether you need a visa or a passport to entry in the specific country. 

The front-end part/client-side of the api was made with Javascript and ReactJS. The back-end part/server-side was made with Node.js and Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. The data was stored in a MongoDB database and the connection between the server and the database was made with Mongoose.
